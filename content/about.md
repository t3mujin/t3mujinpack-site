This pack started by Jo√£o Pedro Almeida while doing regular photo processing and exploring some of Darktable modules, in an attempt to fix the lack of film simulation options, both in quantity and quality for that RAW developer. It was driven by the many options available for the most popular RAW development software applications, but mostly by G'MIC film emulation, which has been one of the main references in the development of these styles. The goal of these is to be as simple as possible by using few Darktable modules, it works solely by manipulating Lab Tone Curves for color manipulation, black & white films rely heavily on Channel Mixer.
